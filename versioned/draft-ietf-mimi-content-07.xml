<section anchor="introduction"><name>Introduction</name>
<t>RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH. The source for
this draft is maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be
submitted as pull requests at <eref target="https://github.com/ietf-wg-mimi/draft-ietf-mimi-content">https://github.com/ietf-wg-mimi/draft-ietf-mimi-content</eref>.
Editorial changes can be managed in GitHub, but any substantive
change should be discussed on the MIMI mailing list (mimi@ietf.org).</t>
<t>MLS <xref target="RFC9420"/> is a group key establishment protocol
motivated by the desire for group chat with efficient end-to-end encryption.
While one of the motivations of MLS is interoperable standards-based secure
messaging, the MLS protocol does not define or prescribe any format for the
encrypted "application messages" encoded by MLS.  The development of MLS
was strongly motivated by the needs of a number of Instant Messaging (IM)
systems, which encrypt messages end-to-end using variations of the
Double Ratchet protocol <xref target="DoubleRatchet"/>.</t>
<t>End-to-end encrypted instant messaging was also a motivator for the Common
Protocol for Instant Messaging (CPIM) <xref target="RFC3862"/>, however the model used at the time
assumed standalone encryption of each message using a protocol such as S/MIME
<xref target="RFC8551"/> or PGP <xref target="RFC3156"/> to interoperate between IM protocols such as
SIP <xref target="RFC3261"/> and XMPP <xref target="RFC6120"/>.  For a variety of practical reasons, interoperable
end-to-end encryption between IM systems was never deployed commercially.</t>
<t>There are now several instant messaging vendors implementing MLS, and the
MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability) Working Group is chartered
to standardize an extensible interoperable messaging format for common
features to be conveyed "inside" MLS application messages.</t>
<t>This document assumes that MLS clients advertise media types they support
and can determine what media types are required to join a
specific MLS group using the content advertisement extensions in Section 2.3 of
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mls-extensions"/>. It allows implementations to define MLS groups
with different media type requirements and allows MLS clients to send
extended or proprietary messages that would be interpreted by some members
of the group while assuring that an interoperable end-to-end encrypted
baseline is available to all members, even when the group spans multiple
systems or vendors.</t>
<t>Below is a list of some features commonly found in IM group chat systems:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>plain text and rich text messaging</li>
<li>mentions</li>
<li>replies</li>
<li>reactions</li>
<li>edit or delete previously sent messages</li>
<li>expiring messages</li>
<li>delivery notifications</li>
<li>read receipts</li>
<li>shared files/audio/videos</li>
<li>calling / conferencing</li>
<li>message threading</li>
</ul>
<t>Delivery notifications and read receipts are addressed in
{{?I-D.mahy-mimi-message-status}}. Calling and conferencing will also be
addressed in another document.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="overview"><name>Overview</name>

<section anchor="binary-encoding"><name>Binary encoding</name>
<t>The MIMI Content format is encoded in Concise Binary Object Representation
(CBOR) <xref target="RFC8949"/>. The Working Group chose a binary format in part because:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>we do not want to scan body parts to check for boundary marker
collisions. This rules out using multipart MIME types.</li>
<li>we do not want to base64 encode body parts with binary media
types (ex: images). This rules out using JSON to carry the binary data.</li>
</ul>
<t>All examples start with an instance document annotated in the CBOR
Extended Diagnostic Notation (described in [Appendix G of @!RFC8610] and
more rigorously specified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals"/>), and then
include a hex dump of the CBOR data in the pretty printed format popularized
by the CBOR playground website (<eref target="https://cbor.me">https://cbor.me</eref>) with some minor whitespace
and comment reformatting. Finally, a message ID for the message is included
for most messages.</t>
<t>All the instance documents validate using the CDDL schemas in Appendix B and
are included in the examples directory in the github repo for this document.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="naming-schemes"><name>Naming schemes</name>
<t>IM systems have a number of types of identifiers. These are described in detail
in <xref target="I-D.mahy-mimi-identity"/>. A few of these used in this document are:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>handle identifier (external, friendly representation). This is the type
of identifier described later as the senderUserUrl in the examples, which
is analogous to the From header in email.</li>
<li>client/device identifier (internal representation). This is the type
of identifier described as the senderClientUrl in the examples.</li>
<li>group or room or conversation or channel name (either internal or external representation).
This is the type of identifier described as the MLS group URL in the examples.</li>
</ul>
<t>This proposal relies on URIs for naming and identifiers. All the example use
the <tt>im:</tt> URI scheme (defined in <xref target="RFC3862"/>), but any instant messaging scheme
could be used.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="message-id"><name>Message ID</name>
<t>The MIMI content format relies heavily on message IDs to refer to other
messages, to reply, react, edit, delete, and report on the status of
messages. Every MIMI content message contains a 16-octet per-message
cryptographically random salt, and has a 32-octet message ID which is calculated
from the hash of the message (including the salt), the sender URI, and the
room URI.</t>
<t>Calculation of the message ID works as follows. The first octet of the MessageID
is the hash function ID from the
<eref target="https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg">IANA hash algorithm registry</eref>.
The sender URI, room URI, the entire MIMI message content (including
the salt), and the salt again are all concatenated, and then hashed with the
algorithm identified in the first octet. The first 31 octets of the hash_output
is appended to the hash function ID.</t>

<artwork><![CDATA[hash_output = hash( senderUri || roomUri || message || salt )
messageId = hashAlg || hash_output[0..30]
]]></artwork>
<t>The MIMI content format uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm (identifier 0x01) by
default, regardless of the hash algorithm of the cipher suite of a room's MLS
group. The initial octet allows the MIMI protocol to deprecate SHA-256 and
specify a new default algorithm in the future (for example if a practical
birthday attack on SHA_256 becomes feasible).</t>
<blockquote><t>The salt is duplicated in the input to the hash to avoid a SHA-256 length
extension attack.</t>
</blockquote></section>

<section anchor="accepted-timestamp"><name>Accepted Timestamp</name>
<t>As described in the MIMI architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-mimi-arch"/>, one
provider, called the hub, is responsible for ordering messages. The hub is
also responsible for recording the time that any application message is
accepted, and conveying it to any "follower" providers which receive messages
from the group. It is represented as the whole number of milliseconds since
the start of the UNIX epoch (01-Jan-1970 00:00:00 UTC). The accepted timestamp
MUST be available to each receiving MIMI client. The client can use it
for fine grain sorting of messages into a consistent order.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="message-container"><name>Message Container</name>
<t>Most common instant messaging features are expressed as individual messages.
A plain or rich text message is obviously a message, but a reaction (ex: like),
a reply, editing a previous message, deleting an earlier message, and read
receipts are all typically modeled as another message with different properties.</t>
<t>This document describes the semantics of a message container, which
can represent most of these previously mentioned message types.
The container typically carries one or more body parts with the actual message
content (for example, an emoji used in a reaction, a plain text or rich text
message or reply, a link, or an inline image).</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="mimi-content-container-message-semantics"><name>MIMI Content Container Message Semantics</name>
<t>Each MIMI Content message is a container format with two categories
of information:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>the message behavior fields (which can have default or empty values), and</li>
<li>the body part(s) and associated parameters</li>
</ul>
<t>The object fields in the structure defined below are numbered in
curly braces for reference in the text.</t>
<t>The subsections that follow contain snippets of Concise Data Definition
Language (CDDL) <xref target="RFC8610"/> schemas for the MIMI Content Container. The complete collected CDDL schema for MIMI Content Container is available in
<xref target="full-schema"/>.</t>

<section anchor="message-behavior-fields"><name>Message Behavior Fields</name>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[mimiContent = [
  salt: bstr .size 16,
  replaces: null / MessageId,       ; {1}
  topicId: bstr,                    ; {2}
  expires: null / Expiration        ; {3}

  extensions: {* name => value },   ; {6}
  nestedPart: NestedPart            ; {7}
]

MessageId = bstr .size 32
]]></sourcecode>
<t>The first data field is the per-message unique salt which MUST be
cryptographically random. An example algorithm for generating the salt
is described in <xref target="salt-generation"/>.</t>
<t>The <tt>replaces</tt> {1} data field indicates that the current message
is a replacement or update to a previous message whose message ID
is in the <tt>replaces</tt> data field. It is used to edit previously-sent
messages, delete previously-sent messages, and adjust reactions to
messages to which the client previously reacted.
 If the <tt>replaces</tt> field is absent, the receiver
assumes that the current message has not identified any special
relationship with another previous message.</t>
<t>The <tt>topicId</tt> {2} data field indicates that the current message is
part of a logical grouping of messages which all share the same
value in the <tt>topicId</tt> data field. If the <tt>topicId</tt> is zero length,
there is no such grouping.</t>
<t>The <tt>expires</tt> {3} data field is a hint from the sender to the receiver
that the message should be locally deleted and disregarded at either a specific
timestamp in the future, or a relative amount of time after the receiving client
reads the message. Indicate a message with no specific expiration
time with the value null. If non-null, the data field is an array of two items.</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[Expiration = [
    relative: bool,
    time: uint .size 4
]
]]></sourcecode>
<t>The first is a boolean indicating if the time is relative (true) or absolute
(false). The second is an unsigned integer. If relative, it is the whole number
of seconds the message should be visible before it is deleted. If absolute, it
is the number of seconds after the start of the UNIX epoch, at which point the
message should be deleted. Using an 32-bit unsigned integer allows expiration
dates until the year 2106. Note that specifying an expiration time provides no
assurance that the client actually honors or can honor the expiration time, nor
that the end user didn't otherwise save the expiring message (ex: via a
screenshot).</t>
<t>The <tt>inReplyTo</tt> {4} data field indicates that the current message is
a related continuation of another message sent in the same MLS group.
If present, it contains the message ID of the referenced message. Otherwise,
the receiver assumes that the current message has not identified any special
reply relationship with another previous message. The message id of the
referenced message is also used to make sure that a MIMI
message cannot refer to a sequence of referred messages which refers
back to itself. When replying, a client MUST NOT knowingly create a sequence
of replies which create a loop.</t>
<t>When receiving a message with inReplyTo message, the client checks if the
referenced message is itself inReplyTo another message. If so, it continues
following the referenced messages, checking that the message ID of none of the
referenced messages "loop" back to a message later in the inReplyTo chain.</t>
<t>Note that a <tt>inReplyTo</tt>
always references a specific message ID. Even if the original message
was edited several times, a reply always refers to a specific version
of that message, and SHOULD refer to the most current version at the
time the reply is sent.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="message-ordering"><name>Message Ordering</name>
<t>Message ordering is provided by the Hub in the form of the accepted
timestamp. A malicious hub may be able to manipulate the order of
messages.</t>
<t>Imagine however that two users (Bob and Cathy) see a message from Alice
offering free Hawaiian pizza, and reply at the same time. Bob and Cathy both send
messages somehow referencing (Alice's)
message about pizza.  Their messages don't need to be replies or reactions.
Bob might just send a message saying he doesn't like pineapple on pizza.</t>
<t>If clients want to detect messages sent out of order by the hub, they
require notification of message delivery at the MLS level (ex: the AppAck
mechanism provided in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mls-extensions"/>) or at the MIMI level,
such as the format defined in {{?I-D.mahy-mimi-message-status}}.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="extension-fields"><name>Extension Fields</name>
<t>In order to add additional functionality to MIMI, senders can include
extension fields in the message format {6}. Each extension has a CBOR map key
which is a positive integer, negative integer, or text string containing between
1 and 255 octets of UTF-8. The value can be any CBOR (including combinations of
maps and arrays) which can be represented in between 0 and 4096 octets.
The message content <tt>extensions</tt> field MUST NOT include more than one
extension field with the same map key.</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[name = int / tstr .size (1..255)
value = any .size (0..4095)
]]></sourcecode>
<t>An IANA registry <xref target="keys-registry"/> is defined for
positive integer keys. Negative integer and text string keys are only for
private use.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="message-bodies"><name>Message Bodies</name>
<t>Every MIMI content message has a body {7} which can have multiple,
possibly nested parts. A body with zero parts is permitted when
deleting or unliking. External body parts <xref target="external"/> are also supported.
When there is a single (inline) part or a (single) externally reference
part, its IANA media type, subtype, and parameters are included in the
contentType field {8}.</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[NestedPart = [
  disposition: baseDispos / $extDispos / unknownDispos,  ; {10}
  language: tstr,                                        ; {11}

]]></sourcecode>
<t>With some types of message content, there are multiple media types
associated with the same message which need to be rendered together,
for example a rich-text message with an inline image. With other
messages, there are multiple choices available for the same content,
for example a choice among multiple languages, or between two
different image formats. The relationship semantics among the parts
is specified as an enumeration {9}.</t>
<t>The <tt>chooseOne</tt> part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics of the
<tt>multipart/alternative</tt> media type, except that the ordering of the
nested body parts is merely a preference of the sender. The receiver
can choose the body part among those provided according to its own
policy.</t>
<t>The <tt>singleUnit</tt> part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics
of the <tt>multipart/related</tt> media type, in that all the nested body
parts at this level are part of a single entity (for example, a
rich text message with an inline image). If the receiver does not
understand even one of the nested parts at this level, the receiver
should not process any of them.</t>
<t>The <tt>processAll</tt> part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics
of the <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> media type. The receiver should process as
many of the nested parts at this level as possible. For example, a
rich text document with a link, and a preview image of the link target
could be expressed using this semantic. Processing the preview image
is not strictly necessary for the correct rendering of the rich text
part.</t>
<t>The disposition {10} and language {11} of each part can be specified
for any part, including for nested parts. The disposition represents
the intended semantics of the body part or a set of nested parts.
It is inspired by the values in the Content-Disposition MIME header
<xref target="RFC2183"/>.</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[baseDispos = &(
    unspecified: 0,
    render: 1,
    reaction: 2,
    profile: 3,
    inline: 4,
    icon: 5,
    attachment: 6,
    session: 7,
    preview: 8
)
; Note: any ext_dispos take precedence
unknownDispos = &( unknown: 9..255 )
]]></sourcecode>
<t>The <tt>render</tt> disposition means that the content should be rendered
according to local policy. The  <tt>inline</tt> dispositions means that the
content should be rendered "inline" directly in the chat interface.
The <tt>attachment</tt> disposition means that the content is intended to
be downloaded by the receiver instead of being rendered immediately.
The <tt>reaction</tt> disposition means that the content is a single
reaction to another message, typically an emoji, but which could be
an image, sound, or video. The <tt>reaction</tt> disposition was originally published
in <xref target="RFC9078"/>, but was incorrectly placed in the Content Disposition
Parameters IANA registry instead of in the Content Disposition Values
registry.
The <tt>session</tt> disposition means that the content is a description of
a multimedia session, or a URI used to join one.
The <tt>preview</tt> disposition means that the content is a sender-generated
preview of something, such as the contents of a link.</t>
<t>The value of the language data field is an empty string or a
comma-separated list of one or more <tt>Language-tag</tt>s as defined
in <xref target="RFC5646"/>.</t>
<t>Each part also has an implied part index, which is a zero-indexed,
depth-first integer. It is used to efficiently refer to a specific
body part (for example, an inline image) within another part. See
<xref target="nesting-example"/> for an example of how the part index is
calculated.</t>
<t>The partIndex can be used inside a content ID URI <xref target="RFC2392"/> in a "container"
part (for example HTML, Markdown, vCard <xref target="RFC6350"/>, or iCal <xref target="RFC5545"/>) to
reference another part inside the same MIMI message. In a MIMI message it has
the form <tt>cid:</tt><em>partIndex</em><tt>@local.invalid</tt>.
This format of the content ID URI in MIMI MUST only reference the <tt>partIndex</tt>
of a SinglePart or ExternalPart.</t>
<t>When processing a MultiPart nested structure, the client can start from the
<tt>body</tt> in the MIMI content (the "top-level" or "root") and evaluate any
<tt>chooseOne</tt> semantics MultiPart elements, effectively discarding non-chosen
Parts. The remaining Parts might still reference each other in content ID URI.
To prevent processing a Part more than once, the client can handle the remaining
Parts in order, skipping any Parts already referenced by a previously handled
Part. This process of skipping already processed Parts is respected regardless
of the disposition of the Part.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="external"><name>External content</name>
<t>It is common in Instant Messaging systems to reference external
content via URI that will be processed automatically, either to
store bulky content (ex: videos, images, recorded sounds) outside
the messaging infrastructure, or to access a specific service URI,
for example, a media forwarding service for conferencing.</t>
<t>An <tt>ExternalPart</tt> is a convenient way to reference this content. It
provides a similar function to the <tt>message/external-body</tt> media type.
It optionally includes the size of the data in octets (or zero if
the length is not provided). It also includes an optional timestamp
after which the external content is invalid, expressed as seconds
since the start of the UNIX epoch (01-Jan-1970), or zero if the
content does not expire.</t>

<sourcecode type="cddl"><![CDATA[ExternalPart = (
    cardinality: external,
    contentType: tstr,     ; An IANA media type {8}
    url: uri,              ; A URL where the content can be fetched
    expires: uint .size 4, ; expiration in seconds since UNIX epoch
    size: uint .size 8,    ; size of content in octets
    encAlg: uint .size 2,  ; An IANA AEAD Algorithm number, or zero
    key: bstr,             ; AEAD key
    nonce: bstr,           ; AEAD nonce
    aad: bstr,             ; AEAD additional authentiation data
    hashAlg: uint .size 1, ; An IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm
    contentHash: bstr,     ; hash of the content at the target url
    description: tstr,     ; an optional text description
    filename: tstr         ; an optional suggested filename
)
]]></sourcecode>
<t>Typically, external content is encrypted with an ephemeral symmetric
key before it is uploaded, and whatever is necessary for decryption
is shared over the message channel.</t>
<t>It is a matter of local policy to where the content is uploaded. Often
in federated messaging systems, the sender of the content stores the
external content in their own domain, but in some systems the content
is stored in the "owning" or "hub" domain of the MLS group.</t>
<t>Before being uploaded, private external content is encrypted with an
IANA-registered Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD)
algorithm as described in <xref target="RFC5116"/>. The key, nonce, and additional
authenticated data (aad) values are set to the values used during the
encryption. Unless modified by an extension, the default value of the
<tt>aad</tt> is empty.</t>
<t>If the external URL is a service, or the external content is not considered
private, the <tt>encAlg</tt> is set to zero, and the <tt>key</tt>, <tt>nonce</tt>, and <tt>aad</tt>
fields are zero length.</t>
<t>Implementations of this specification MUST implement the AES-128-GCM
algorithm.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="derived-data-values"><name>Derived Data Values</name>
<t>In addition to fields which are contained in a MIMI content message,
there is the hub accepted timestamp, which can be represented either
as milliseconds since the start of the UNIX epoch, or for future
extensibility as a CBOR extended time tag as defined in {{Section 3 of
!RFC9581}}. There are also two fields the implementation can definitely derive:
(the MLS group ID {12}, and the leaf index of the sender {13}). Many
implementations could also determine one or more of: the sender's client
identifier URL {14}, the user identifier URL of the credential associated
with the sender {15}, and the identifier URL for the MIMI room {16}.</t>

<section anchor="examples"><name>Examples</name>
<t>In the following examples, we assume that an MLS group is already established and
that either out-of-band or using the MLS protocol or MLS extensions, or
their client to provider protocol that the following is known to every
member of the group:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>The membership of the group (via MLS).</li>
<li>The identity of any MLS client which sends an application message (via MLS).</li>
<li>The MLS group ID (via MLS)</li>
<li>The human-readable name(s) of the MIMI room, if any (out-of-band or extension).</li>
<li>Which media types are mandatory to implement (MLS content advertisement extensions).</li>
<li>For each member, the media types each supports (MLS content advertisement extensions).</li>
</ul>
<t>Messages sent to an MLS group are delivered to every member of the group
active during the epoch in which the message was sent.</t>
<t>All the examples start with a CBOR instance document annotated in the
Extended Diagnostic Format (described in [Appendix G of @!RFC8610] and more

<t>In this example, Alice Smith sends a rich-text (Markdown) <xref target="RFC7763"/>
message to the Engineering Team room. The following values are
derived from the client, except for the hub received timestamp, which
needs to be made available to the client by its provider:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Sender MLS leaf index: 4</li>

<t>A reply message looks similar, but contains the message ID of the
original message in the <tt>inReplyTo</tt> data field. The derived MLS
group ID, URL, and name do not change in this example. The derived
senderClientId and senderLeafIndex are not especially relevant so
only the user handle URL, message ID, and hub received timestamp
are provided (in comments at the beginning of the annotated EDN).
The annotated EDN follows, then the pretty printed CBOR.</t>

<section anchor="reaction"><name>Reaction</name>
<t>A reaction looks like a reply, but uses the Disposition token of reaction. It is
modeled on the reaction Content-Disposition token defined in <xref target="RFC9078"/>.
Both indicate that the intended disposition of the
contents of the message is a reaction.</t>
<t>The content in the sample message is a single Unicode heart character (U+2665)
which is expressed in UTF-8 as 0xe299a5.
Discovering the range of characters each implementation could render as a
reaction can occur out-of-band and is not within the scope of this proposal.
However, an implementation which receives a reaction character string it
does not recognize could render the reaction as a reply, possibly prefixing
with a localized string such as "Reaction: ".  Note that a reaction could
theoretically even be another media type (ex: image, audio, or video), although
not currently implemented in major instant messaging systems.
Note that many systems allow multiple independent reactions per sender.</t>

<section anchor="mentions"><name>Mentions</name>
<t>In instant messaging systems and social media, a mention allows special
formatting and behavior when a name, handle, or tag associated with a
known group is encountered, often when prefixed with a commercial-at "@"
character for mentions of users or a hash "#" character for groups or tags.
A message which contains a mention may trigger distinct notifications on
the IM client.</t>
<t>We can convey a mention by linking the user handle URI, or group URI in Markdown
or HTML rich content. For example, a mention using Markdown is indicated below.</t>

<t>Unlike with email messages, it is common in IM systems to allow the sender of
a message to edit or delete the message after the fact. Typically, the message
is replaced in the user interface of the receivers (even after the original
message is read) but shows a visual indication that it has been edited.</t>
<t>The <tt>replaces</tt> data field includes the message ID of the message to
edit/replace. The message included in the body is a replacement for the message
with the replaced message ID.</t>
<t>Here Bob Jones corrects a typo in his original message:</t>

<t>Note that replies and reactions always refer to a specific message id,
and therefore a specific "version" of a message, which could have been
edited before and/or after the message id referenced in the reply or reaction.
It is a matter of local policy how to render (if at all) a reaction to
a subsequently edited message.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="delete"><name>Delete</name>
<t>In IM systems, a delete means that the author of a specific message has
retracted the message, regardless if other users have read the message
or not. Typically, a placeholder remains in the user interface showing
that a message was deleted. Replies which reference a deleted message
typically hide the quoted portion and reflect that the original message
was deleted.</t>
<t>If Bob deleted his message instead of modifying it, we would represent it
using the <tt>replaces</tt> data field, and using an empty body (NullPart),
as shown below.</t>

<section anchor="expiring"><name>Expiring</name>
<t>There are two types of expiring messages in instant messaging systems. In the
typical implementation, messages are deleted a specific amount of time relative
to (after) when the receiving client reads the message. We will refer to this as
relative expiration.</t>
<t>Absolute expiring messages are designed to be deleted automatically by the
receiving client at a certain time whether they have been read or not.</t>
<t>As with manually deleted messages, there is no guarantee that an uncooperative
client or a determined user will not save the content of the message. The goal
instead is to allow cooperating client that respect the convention to signal
expiration times clearly.</t>
<t>The <tt>expires</tt> data field contains the absolute timestamp when, or relative
amount of time after reading, after which the message can be deleted.
The semantics of the header are that the message is automatically deleted
by the receiving clients at the indicated time without user interaction or
network connectivity necessary.</t>

<t>Joining a conference via an external URL is possible. The link could be
rendered to the user, requiring a click. Alternatively the URL could be
in an ExternalPart with a disposition of <tt>session</tt>, which could be processed
differently by the client (for example, alerting the user or presenting
a dialog box).
Further discussion of calling and conferencing functionality is out-of-scope

<section anchor="topics-threading"><name>Topics / Threading</name>
<t>As popularized by the messaging application Slack, some messaging
applications have a notion of a Topic or message Thread
(not to be confused with message threading as used in email).
Clients beginning a new "topic" populate the <tt>topicId</tt> with a unique
opaque octet string. This could be the message ID of the first message
sent related to the topic. Subsequent messages may include the same
<tt>topicId</tt> for those messages to be associated with the same topic. The sort order
for messages within a thread uses the timestamp field. If more than
one message has the same timestamp, the lexically lowest message ID
sorts earlier.</t>

<section anchor="support-for-specific-media-types"><name>Support for Specific Media Types</name>

<section anchor="mimi-required-and-recommended-media-types"><name>MIMI Required and Recommended media types</name>
<t>As the MIMI Content container is just a container, the plain text or rich
text messages sent inside, and any image or other formats needs to be specified.
Clients compliant with MIMI MUST be able to receive the following media types:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>application/mimi-content -- the MIMI Content container format (described in this document)</li>
<li>text/plain;charset=utf-8</li>
<li>text/markdown;variant=GFM-MIMI -- Github Flavored Markdown for MIMI, defined in <xref target="gfm-mimi"/></li>
</ul>
<t>Note that it is acceptable to render the contents of a received markdown
document as plain text.</t>
<t>The following MIME types are RECOMMENDED:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>text/markdown;variant=CommonMark -- <eref target="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30">CommonMark</eref></li>
<li>text/html</li>
<li>image/jpeg</li>
<li>image/png</li>
</ul>
<t>Clients compliant with this specification must be able to download
ExternalParts with <tt>http</tt> and <tt>https</tt> URLs, and decrypt downloaded content
encrypted with the AES-128-GCM AEAD algorithm.</t>

<section anchor="gfm-mimi"><name>Specifics of Github Flavored Markdown in MIMI</name>
<t>A MIMI content client supports GitHub Flavored Markdown as defined in <xref target="GFM"/>,
with two changes: the Autolink extension is not supported; and instead of the
Disallowed Raw HTML extension (<tt>tagfilter</tt>), the No HTML extension (<tt>nohtml</tt>),
which is defined here, is MANDATORY. (For clarity, a fixed list of supported
extensions, is further described in the bullet points below.)</t>
<t>To implement the No HTML extension to GFM, the opening angle bracket (<tt>&lt;</tt>) of
any <tt>HTML tag</tt> (as defined in Section 6.10 of <xref target="GFM"/>) is replaced with <tt>&amp;lt;</tt>
before sending. Any <tt>HTML tag</tt> in a received message is rendered as plain text.
Note that <tt>HTML tag</tt> includes open tags, closing tags, HTML comments, processing
instructions, declarations, and CDATA sections.</t>
<t>The following GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions are supported. No other extensions are allowed:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Tables</li>
<li>Task list items</li>
<li>Strikethrough</li>
<li>No HTML</li>
</ul>
<t>This document specifies what can be sent inside a MIMI content message; it does
not restrict or prescribe in any way how input from a user is interpreted by an
Instant Messaging client that support MIMI, before any message resulting from
that input is sent.</t>
<t>Note that rendering Markdown as plain text is an acceptable form of "support".</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="use-of-proprietary-media-types"><name>Use of proprietary media types</name>
<t>As most messaging systems are proprietary, standalone systems, it is useful to allow
clients to send and receive proprietary formats among themselves. Using the
functionality in the MIMI Content container, clients can send a message using the basic
functionality described in this document AND a proprietary format for
same-vendor clients simultaneously over the same group with end-to-end
encryption. An example is given in the Appendix.</t>

<section anchor="keys-registry"><name>MIMI Content Extension Keys registry</name>
<t>This document requests the creation of a new MIMI Content Extension Keys
registry.
The registry should be under the heading of "More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)".</t>
<t>The MIMI Content format defined in this document, contains an extensions map in
each message. The keys in the extensions map can be (positive or negative)
integers, or text strings. Text strings and negative integer keys are reserved
for private use. Positive integer keys are assigned in the registry under the
Expert Review policy <xref target="RFC8126"/>. Integer keys between 1 and 255 are restricted
to IETF consensus specifications.</t>
<t>The columns in the registry are as follows:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Key: The extension map key positive integer assigned to the MIMI content extension.</li>
<li>Name: a short descriptive name for the MIMI content extension.</li>
<li>Type: The CBOR data type of the value corresponding to the key. Applications
with multiple, related data items are encouraged to register a map type that
contains all the related fields.</li>
<li><t>Recommended: Whether support for this MIMI content extension is recommended by
the IETF. Valid values are "Y", "N", and "D", as described below. The default
value of the "Recommended" column is "N". Setting the Recommended item to "Y" or
"D", or changing an item whose current value is "Y" or "D", requires Standards
Action <xref target="RFC8126"/>.</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>Y: Indicates that the IETF has consensus, and that the item is
RECOMMENDED. This only means that the associated mechanism is fit for the
purpose for which it was defined. Careful reading of the documentation for the
mechanism is necessary to understand the applicability of that mechanism. The
IETF could recommend mechanisms that have limited applicability, but will
provide applicability statements that describe any limitations of the mechanism
or necessary constraints on its use.</li>
<li>N: Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and that the
IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the associated mechanism.
This does not necessarily mean that the mechanism is flawed, only that no
consensus exists. The IETF might have consensus to leave an item marked as "N"
on the basis of it having limited applicability or usage constraints.</li>
<li>D: Indicates that the item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be
used. This marking could be used to identify mechanisms that might result in
problems if they are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism
that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.</li>

<section anchor="expert-review"><name>Expert Review</name>
<t>Expert Review <xref target="RFC8126"/> registry requests are registered
after a three-week review period on the MIMI Designated Expert (DE) mailing list
<eref target="mailto:mimi-reg-review@ietf.org">mimi-reg-review@ietf.org</eref> on the advice of one or more of the MIMI DEs.</t>
<t>Registration requests sent to the MIMI DEs' mailing list for review
SHOULD use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register value
in MIMI Content Extensions Keys registry").</t>
<t>Within the review period, the MIMI DEs will either approve or deny
the registration request, communicating this decision to the MIMI DEs'
mailing list and IANA. Denials SHOULD include an explanation and, if
applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request successful.
Registration requests that are undetermined for a period longer than
21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention for resolution using
the <eref target="mailto:iesg@ietf.org">iesg@ietf.org</eref> mailing list.</t>
<t>Criteria that SHOULD be applied by the MIMI DEs includes determining
whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
whether it is likely to be of general applicability or useful only
for a single application, and whether the registration description
is clear.</t>
<t>IANA MUST only accept registry updates from the MIMI DEs and SHOULD
direct all requests for registration to the MIMI DEs' mailing list.</t>
<t>In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as creating a conflict
of interest for a particular MIMI DE, that MIMI DE SHOULD defer to the judgment
of the other MIMI DEs.</t>

<section anchor="salt-generation"><name>Generating the random salt</name>
<t>To ensure a strong source of entropy for the per-message unique salt required in
each message, the client can export a secret from the MLS key schedule, for
example with the label <tt>salt_base_secret</tt> and calculate the salt as the first
16-octets of the HMAC of a locally generated nonce and the franking_base_secret.</t>

<section anchor="rendering-and-authorization-of-edits-and-deletes"><name>Rendering and authorization of edits and deletes</name>
<t>This content format allows clients to send new versions of previously sent
messages, effectively replacing ("editing") or retracting ("deleting") another
referenced message. The rendering of these "edits" and "deletes" are important
from a security perspective.</t>
<t>For example, if Alice writes "Bob, could I borow a pen?", and Bob reacts with a
thumbs up emoji, Alice might edit this message with no change in meaning
(correcting the spelling of "borrow"), or a dramatic change in meaning ("Bob,
could I borrow your Ferrari this month?"). The receiver SHOULD indicate clearly
that a received message has been edited or retracted. The receiver might:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>offer an option to view previous versions of a message,</li>
<li>show a summarized or thumbnail version of a message referenced in a reply,</li>
<li>indicate clearly that a reply was to a previous version of a message than the
most recent one.</li>
<li>show a detailed view of reaction indicating that some reactions referred to a
previous version of the message.</li>
</ul>
<t>In addition, some groups may have special policies or permissions allowing
specific types of edits or deletes. For example, a moderator in one room might
be allowed to edit the topic of a message, but not modify the rest of the
content. An administrator might be allowed to delete messages which violate the
policy of the group. Receiving clients MUST NOT allow parties other than the
original sender of a message to edit or delete that message, unless there is a
specific, concrete authorization policy which allows it. Likewise, even the
original sender of a message MUST NOT be able to change the semantics of any
other portion of the message except for the contents of the NestedPart, without
specific authorization.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="validation-of-timestamp"><name>Validation of timestamp</name>
<t>The timestamp is the time a message is accepted by the hub provider. As such,
the hub provider can manipulate the timestamp, and the sending provider
can delay sending messages selectively to cause the timestamp on a hub to
be later.
Note that the optional franking mechanism discussed in Section 5.4.1.2 of
<xref target="I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol"/> prevents follower servers from modifying the
timestamp.</t>
<blockquote><t><strong>TODO</strong>: Discuss how to sanity check lastSeen, timestamp and the MLS
epoch and generation, and the limitations of this approach.</t>
</blockquote></section>

<section anchor="alternate-content-rendering"><name>Alternate content rendering</name>
<t>This document includes a mechanism where the sender can offer alternate
versions of content in a single message. For example, the sender could
send:</t>

<ul spacing="compact">
<li>an plain text and an HTML version of a text message</li>
<li>a thumbnail preview and link to a high-resolution image or video</li>
<li>versions of the same message in multiple languages</li>
<li>an PNG image and a scalable vector graphics version of a line drawing</li>
</ul>
<t>A malicious client could use this mechanism to send content that will appear
different to a subset of the members of a group and possibly elicit an
incorrect or misleading response.</t>

</section>

<section anchor="link-and-mention-handling"><name>Link and Mention handling</name>
<t>Both Markdown and HTML support links. Using the example of an <tt>https</tt> link,
if the rendered text and the link target match exactly or are canonically
equivalent, there is no need for confirmation if the end user selects the link.</t>

<artwork><![CDATA[[example.com/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)
[https://example.com/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)
[https://example.com:443/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)
]]></artwork>
<t>However, if the link text is different, or the scheme is downgraded
from https to http, the user should be presented with
an alert warning that the text is not the same.</t>

<artwork><![CDATA[[https://example.com/foobar](https://spearphishers.example/foobar)
[https://example.com/foobar](http://example.com/foobar)
]]></artwork>
<t>An IM URI link to a user who has a member client in the MLS
group in which the message was sent is considered a mention. Clients may
support special rendering of mentions instead of treating them like any
other type of link. In Markdown and HTML, the display text portion of a
link is considered a rendering hint from the sender to the receiver of
the message. The receiver should use local policy to decide if the hint
is an acceptable local representation of the user represented by the link
itself. If the hint is not an acceptable representation, the client should
instead display its canonical representation for the user.</t>
<t>For example, in the first example, the sender expresses no preference
about how to render the mention. In the second example, the sender requests
that the mention is rendered as the literal URI. In the third example, the
sender requests the canonical handle for Alice. In the fourth example, the
sender requests Alice's first name.</t>

<artwork><![CDATA[<mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith>
[mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)
[@AliceSmith](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)
[Alice](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)
]]></artwork>
<t>Note that in some clients, presence of a mention for the local user may
result in a different notification policy.</t>
<t>If the client does not support special rendering of mentions, the
application, should render the text like any other link.</t>

<section anchor="multipart-examples"><name>Multipart examples</name>
<t>In a heterogeneous group of IM clients, it is often desirable to send more than one
media type as alternatives, such that IM clients have a choice of which media
type to render. For example, imagine an IM group containing a set of clients
which support a common video format and a subset which only support animated GIFs.
The sender could use a <tt>MultiPart</tt> NestablePart with <tt>chooseOne</tt> semantics
containing both media types. Every client in the group chat could render something
resembling the media sent. This is analogous to the <tt>multipart/alternative</tt> <xref target="RFC2046"/>
media type.</t>
<t>Likewise, it is often desirable to send more than one media type intended to be
rendered together as in (for example a rich text document with embedded images),
which can be represented using a <tt>MultiPart</tt> NestablePart with <tt>processAll</tt>
semantics. This is analogous to the <tt>multipart/mixed</tt> <xref target="RFC2046"/> media type.</t>
<t>Note that there is a minor semantic difference between multipart/alternative and
<tt>MultiPart</tt> with <tt>chooseOne</tt> semantics. In multipart/alternative, the parts are
presented in preference order by the sender. With <tt>MultiPart</tt> the receiver
chooses its "best" format to render according to its own preferences.</t>

<section anchor="proprietary-and-common-formats-sent-as-alternatives"><name>Proprietary and Common formats sent as alternatives</name>

messaging format simultaneously.</t>
