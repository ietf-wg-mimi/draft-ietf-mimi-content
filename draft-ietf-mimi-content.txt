1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terms MLS client, MLS group, and KeyPackage have the same
   meanings as in the MLS protocol [RFC9420].  Other relevant
   terminology can be found in [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch].

2.  Introduction

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH.  The source for
   this draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should be
   submitted as pull requests at https://github.com/ietf-wg-mimi/draft-
   ietf-mimi-content (https://github.com/ietf-wg-mimi/draft-ietf-mimi-
   content).  Editorial changes can be managed in GitHub, but any
   substantive change should be discussed on the MIMI mailing list
   (mimi@ietf.org).

   MLS [RFC9420] is a group key establishment protocol motivated by the
   desire for group chat with efficient end-to-end encryption.  While
   one of the motivations of MLS is interoperable standards-based secure
   messaging, the MLS protocol does not define or prescribe any format
   for the encrypted "application messages" encoded by MLS.  The
   development of MLS was strongly motivated by the needs of a number of
   Instant Messaging (IM) systems, which encrypt messages end-to-end
   using variations of the Double Ratchet protocol [DoubleRatchet].

   End-to-end encrypted instant messaging was also a motivator for the
   Common Protocol for Instant Messaging (CPIM) [RFC3862], however the
   model used at the time assumed standalone encryption of each message
   using a protocol such as S/MIME [RFC8551] or PGP [RFC3156] to
   interoperate between IM protocols such as SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP
   [RFC6120].  For a variety of practical reasons, interoperable end-to-
   end encryption between IM systems was never deployed commercially.

   There are now several instant messaging vendors implementing MLS, and
   the MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability) Working Group is
   chartered to standardize an extensible interoperable messaging format
   for common features to be conveyed "inside" MLS application messages.

   This document assumes that MLS clients advertise media types they
   support and can determine what media types are required to join a
   specific MLS group using the content advertisement extensions in
   Section 2.3 of [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions].  It allows implementations
   to define MLS groups with different media type requirements and
   allows MLS clients to send extended or proprietary messages that
   would be interpreted by some members of the group while assuring that
   an interoperable end-to-end encrypted baseline is available to all
   members, even when the group spans multiple systems or vendors.

   Below is a list of some features commonly found in IM group chat
   systems:

   *  plain text and rich text messaging
   *  mentions
   *  replies
   *  reactions
   *  edit or delete previously sent messages
   *  expiring messages
   *  delivery notifications
   *  read receipts
   *  shared files/audio/videos
   *  calling / conferencing
   *  message threading

3.  Overview

3.1.  Binary encoding

   The MIMI Content format is encoded in Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR) [RFC8949].  The Working Group chose a binary
   format in part because:

   *  we do not want to scan body parts to check for boundary marker
      collisions.  This rules out using multipart MIME types.
   *  we do not want to base64 encode body parts with binary media types
      (ex: images).  This rules out using JSON to carry the binary data.

   All examples start with an instance document annotated in the CBOR
   Extended Diagnostic Notation (described in [Appendix G of @!RFC8610]
   and more rigorously specified in [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]), and
   then include a hex dump of the CBOR data in the pretty printed format
   popularized by the CBOR playground website (https://cbor.me
   (https://cbor.me)) with some minor whitespace and comment
   reformatting.  Finally, a message ID for the message is included for
   most messages.

   All the instance documents validate using the CDDL schemas in
   Appendix B and are included in the examples directory in the github
   repo for this document.

3.2.  Naming schemes

   IM systems have a number of types of identifiers.  These are
   described in detail in [I-D.mahy-mimi-identity].  A few of these used
   in this document are:

   *  handle identifier (external, friendly representation).  This is
      the type of identifier described later as the senderUserUrl in the
      examples, which is analogous to the From header in email.
   *  client/device identifier (internal representation).  This is the
      type of identifier described as the senderClientUrl in the
      examples.
   *  group or room or conversation or channel name (either internal or
      external representation).  This is the type of identifier
      described as the MLS group URL in the examples.

   This proposal relies on URIs for naming and identifiers.  All the
   example use the im: URI scheme (defined in [RFC3862]), but any
   instant messaging scheme could be used.

3.3.  Message ID

   The MIMI content format relies heavily on message IDs to refer to
   other messages, to reply, react, edit, delete, and report on the
   status of messages.  Every MIMI content message contains a 32-octet
   per-message cryptographically random salt, and has a 32-octet message
   ID which is calculated from the hash of the message (including the
   salt), the sender URI, and the room URI.

   Calculation of the message ID works as follows.  The first octet of
   the MessageID is the hash function ID from the IANA hash algorithm
   registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-
   information.xhtml#hash-alg).  The sender URI, room URI, the entire
   MIMI message content (including the salt), and the salt again are all
   concatenated, and then hashed with the algorithm identified in the
   first octet.  The first 31 octets of the hash_output is appended to
   the hash function ID.

   hash_output = hash( senderUri || roomUri || message || salt )
   messageId = hashAlg || hash_output[0..30]

   The MIMI content format uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm (identifier
   0x01) by default, regardless of the hash algorithm of the cipher
   suite of a room's MLS group.  The initial octet allows the MIMI
   protocol to deprecate SHA-256 and specify a new default algorithm in
   the future (for example if a practical birthday attack on SHA_256
   becomes feasible).

   |  The salt is duplicated in the input to the hash to avoid a SHA-256
   |  length extension attack.

3.4.  Accepted Timestamp

   As described in the MIMI architecture [I-D.ietf-mimi-arch], one
   provider, called the hub, is responsible for ordering messages.  The
   hub is also responsible for recording the time that any application
   message is accepted, and conveying it to any "follower" providers
   which receive messages from the group.  It is represented as the
   whole number of milliseconds since the start of the UNIX epoch
   (01-Jan-1970 00:00:00 UTC).  The accepted timestamp MUST be available
   to each receiving MIMI client.  The client can use it for fine grain
   sorting of messages into a consistent order.

3.5.  Message Container

   Most common instant messaging features are expressed as individual
   messages.  A plain or rich text message is obviously a message, but a
   reaction (ex: like), a reply, editing a previous message, deleting an
   earlier message, and read receipts are all typically modeled as
   another message with different properties.

   This document describes the semantics of a message container, which
   can represent most of these previously mentioned message types.  The
   container typically carries one or more body parts with the actual
   message content (for example, an emoji used in a reaction, a plain
   text or rich text message or reply, a link, or an inline image).

3.6.  Message Status Report

   This document also describes the semantics of a status report of
   other messages.  Because some messaging systems deliver messages in
   batches and allow a user to mark several messages read at a time, the
   report format defined in Section 6 allows a single report to convey
   the read/delivered status of multiple messages (by message ID) within
   the same MLS group at a time.

4.  MIMI Content Container Message Semantics

   Each MIMI Content message is a container format with two categories
   of information:

   *  the message behavior fields (which can have default or empty
      values), and
   *  the body part(s) and associated parameters

   The object fields in the structure defined below are numbered in
   curly braces for reference in the text.

   The subsections that follow contain snippets of Concise Data
   Definition Language (CDDL) [RFC8610] schemas for the MIMI Content
   Container.  The complete collected CDDL schema for MIMI Content
   Container is available in Appendix A.1.

4.1.  Message Behavior Fields

   mimiContent = [
     salt: bstr .size 16,
     replaces: null / MessageId,       ; {1}
     topicId: bstr,                    ; {2}
     expires: null / Expiration        ; {3}
     inReplyTo: null / InReplyTo,      ; {4}
     extensions: {* name => value },   ; {6}
     nestedPart: NestedPart            ; {7}
   ]

   MessageId = bstr .size 32

   The first data field is the per-message unique salt which MUST be
   cryptographically random.  An example algorithm for generating the
   salt is described in Section 9.2.

   The replaces {1} data field indicates that the current message is a
   replacement or update to a previous message whose message ID is in
   the replaces data field.  It is used to edit previously-sent
   messages, delete previously-sent messages, and adjust reactions to
   messages to which the client previously reacted.  If the replaces
   field is absent, the receiver assumes that the current message has
   not identified any special relationship with another previous
   message.

   The topicId {2} data field indicates that the current message is part
   of a logical grouping of messages which all share the same value in
   the topicId data field.  If the topicId is zero length, there is no
   such grouping.

   The expires {3} data field is a hint from the sender to the receiver
   that the message should be locally deleted and disregarded at either
   a specific timestamp in the future, or a relative amount of time
   after the receiving client reads the message.  Indicate a message
   with no specific expiration time with the value null.  If non-null,
   the data field is an array of two items.

   Expiration = [
       relative: bool,
       time: uint .size 4
   ]

   The first is a boolean indicating if the time is relative (true) or
   absolute (false).  The second is an unsigned integer.  If relative,
   it is the whole number of seconds the message should be visible
   before it is deleted.  If absolute, it is the number of seconds after
   the start of the UNIX epoch, at which point the message should be
   deleted.  Using an 32-bit unsigned integer allows expiration dates
   until the year 2106.  Note that specifying an expiration time
   provides no assurance that the client actually honors or can honor
   the expiration time, nor that the end user didn't otherwise save the
   expiring message (ex: via a screenshot).

   The inReplyTo {4} data field indicates that the current message is a
   related continuation of another message sent in the same MLS group.
   If present, it contains the message ID of the referenced message.
   Otherwise, the receiver assumes that the current message has not
   identified any special reply relationship with another previous
   message.  The message id of the referenced message is also used to
   make sure that a MIMI message cannot refer to a sequence of referred
   messages which refers back to itself.  When replying, a client MUST
   NOT knowingly create a sequence of replies which create a loop.

   When receiving a message with inReplyTo message, the client checks if
   the referenced message is itself inReplyTo another message.  If so,
   it continues following the referenced messages, checking that the
   message ID of none of the referenced messages "loop" back to a
   message later in the inReplyTo chain.

   Note that a inReplyTo always references a specific message ID.  Even
   if the original message was edited several times, a reply always
   refers to a specific version of that message, and SHOULD refer to the
   most current version at the time the reply is sent.

4.2.  Message Ordering

   Message ordering is provided by the Hub in the form of the accepted
   timestamp.  A malicious hub may be able to manipulate the order of
   messages.

   Imagine however that two users (Bob and Cathy) see a message from
   Alice offering free Hawaiian pizza, and reply at the same time.  Bob
   and Cathy both send messages somehow referencing (Alice's) message
   about pizza.  Their messages don't need to be replies or reactions.
   Bob might just send a message saying he doesn't like pineapple on
   pizza.

   If clients want to detect messages sent out of order by the hub, they
   require notification of message delivery at the MLS level (ex: the
   AppAck mechanism provided in [I-D.ietf-mls-extensions]) or at the
   MIMI level, such as the format defined in Section 6.

4.3.  Extension Fields

   In order to add additional functionality to MIMI, senders can include
   extension fields in the message format {6}. Each extension has a CBOR
   map key which is a positive integer, negative integer, or text string
   containing between 1 and 255 octets of UTF-8.  The value can be any
   CBOR (including combinations of maps and arrays) which can be
   represented in between 0 and 4096 octets.  The message content
   extensions field MUST NOT include more than one extension field with
   the same map key.

   name = int / tstr .size (1..255)
   value = any .size (0..4095)

   An IANA registry Section 8.3 is defined for positive integer keys.
   Negative integer and text string keys are only for private use.

4.4.  Message Bodies

   Every MIMI content message has a body {7} which can have multiple,
   possibly nested parts.  A body with zero parts is permitted when
   deleting or unliking.  External body parts Section 4.5 are also
   supported.  When there is a single (inline) part or a (single)
   externally reference part, its IANA media type, subtype, and
   parameters are included in the contentType field {8}.

   NestedPart = [
     disposition: baseDispos / $extDispos / unknownDispos,  ; {10}
     language: tstr,                                        ; {11}
     ( NullPart // SinglePart // ExternalPart // MultiPart)
   ]

   NullPart = ( cardinality: nullpart )

   SinglePart = (
       cardinality: single,
       contentType: tstr,        ; {8}
       content: bstr
   )

   ExternalPart = (
       cardinality: external,
       contentType: tstr,
       url: uri,
       expires: uint .size 4,
       size: uint .size 8,
       encAlg: uint .size 2,
       key: bstr,
       nonce: bstr,
       aad: bstr,
       hashAlg: uint .size 1,
       contentHash: bstr,
       description: tstr,
       filename: tstr
   )

   MultiPart = (
       cardinality: multi,
       partSemantics: chooseOne / singleUnit / processAll,
       parts: [2* NestedPart]
   )

   ; cardinality
   nullpart = 0
   single   = 1
   external = 2
   multi    = 3

   ; part semantics {9}
   chooseOne  = 0  ; receiver picks exactly one part to process
   singleUnit = 1  ; receiver processes all parts as single unit
   processAll = 2  ; receiver processes all parts individually

   With some types of message content, there are multiple media types
   associated with the same message which need to be rendered together,
   for example a rich-text message with an inline image.  With other
   messages, there are multiple choices available for the same content,
   for example a choice among multiple languages, or between two
   different image formats.  The relationship semantics among the parts
   is specified as an enumeration {9}.

   The chooseOne part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics of
   the multipart/alternative media type, except that the ordering of the
   nested body parts is merely a preference of the sender.  The receiver
   can choose the body part among those provided according to its own
   policy.

   The singleUnit part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics of
   the multipart/related media type, in that all the nested body parts
   at this level are part of a single entity (for example, a rich text
   message with an inline image).  If the receiver does not understand
   even one of the nested parts at this level, the receiver should not
   process any of them.

   The processAll part semantic is roughly analogous to the semantics of
   the multipart/mixed media type.  The receiver should process as many
   of the nested parts at this level as possible.  For example, a rich
   text document with a link, and a preview image of the link target
   could be expressed using this semantic.  Processing the preview image
   is not strictly necessary for the correct rendering of the rich text
   part.

   The disposition {10} and language {11} of each part can be specified
   for any part, including for nested parts.  The disposition represents
   the intended semantics of the body part or a set of nested parts.  It
   is inspired by the values in the Content-Disposition MIME header
   [RFC2183].

   baseDispos = &(
       unspecified: 0,
       render: 1,
       reaction: 2,
       profile: 3,
       inline: 4,
       icon: 5,
       attachment: 6,
       session: 7,
       preview: 8
   )
   ; Note: any ext_dispos take precedence
   unknownDispos = &( unknown: 9..255 )

   The render disposition means that the content should be rendered
   according to local policy.  The inline dispositions means that the
   content should be rendered "inline" directly in the chat interface.
   The attachment disposition means that the content is intended to be
   downloaded by the receiver instead of being rendered immediately.
   The reaction disposition means that the content is a single reaction
   to another message, typically an emoji, but which could be an image,
   sound, or video.  The reaction disposition was originally published
   in [RFC9078], but was incorrectly placed in the Content Disposition
   Parameters IANA registry instead of in the Content Disposition Values
   registry.  The session disposition means that the content is a
   description of a multimedia session, or a URI used to join one.  The
   preview disposition means that the content is a sender-generated
   preview of something, such as the contents of a link.

   The value of the language data field is an empty string or a comma-
   separated list of one or more Language-tags as defined in [RFC5646].

   Each part also has an implied part index, which is a zero-indexed,
   depth-first integer.  It is used to efficiently refer to a specific
   body part (for example, an inline image) within another part.  See
   Appendix B.3 for an example of how the part index is calculated.

   The partIndex can be used inside a content ID URI [RFC2392] in a
   "container" part (for example HTML, Markdown, vCard [RFC6350], or
   iCal [RFC5545]) to reference another part inside the same MIMI
   message.  In a MIMI message it has the form
   cid:_partIndex_@local.invalid.  This format of the content ID URI in
   MIMI MUST only reference the partIndex of a SinglePart or
   ExternalPart.

   When processing a MultiPart nested structure, the client can start
   from the body in the MIMI content (the "top-level" or "root") and
   evaluate any chooseOne semantics MultiPart elements, effectively
   discarding non-chosen Parts.  The remaining Parts might still
   reference each other in content ID URI.  To prevent processing a Part
   more than once, the client can handle the remaining Parts in order,
   skipping any Parts already referenced by a previously handled Part.
   This process of skipping already processed Parts is respected
   regardless of the disposition of the Part.

4.5.  External content

   It is common in Instant Messaging systems to reference external
   content via URI that will be processed automatically, either to store
   bulky content (ex: videos, images, recorded sounds) outside the
   messaging infrastructure, or to access a specific service URI, for
   example, a media forwarding service for conferencing.

   An ExternalPart is a convenient way to reference this content.  It
   provides a similar function to the message/external-body media type.
   It optionally includes the size of the data in octets (or zero if the
   length is not provided).  It also includes an optional timestamp
   after which the external content is invalid, expressed as seconds
   since the start of the UNIX epoch (01-Jan-1970), or zero if the
   content does not expire.

   ExternalPart = (
       cardinality: external,
       contentType: tstr,     ; An IANA media type {8}
       url: uri,              ; A URL where the content can be fetched
       expires: uint .size 4, ; expiration in seconds since UNIX epoch
       size: uint .size 8,    ; size of content in octets
       encAlg: uint .size 2,  ; An IANA AEAD Algorithm number, or zero
       key: bstr,             ; AEAD key
       nonce: bstr,           ; AEAD nonce
       aad: bstr,             ; AEAD additional authentiation data
       hashAlg: uint .size 1, ; An IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm
       contentHash: bstr,     ; hash of the content at the target url
       description: tstr,     ; an optional text description
       filename: tstr         ; an optional suggested filename
   )

   Typically, external content is encrypted with an ephemeral symmetric
   key before it is uploaded, and whatever is necessary for decryption
   is shared over the message channel.

   It is a matter of local policy to where the content is uploaded.
   Often in federated messaging systems, the sender of the content
   stores the external content in their own domain, but in some systems
   the content is stored in the "owning" or "hub" domain of the MLS
   group.

   Before being uploaded, private external content is encrypted with an
   IANA-registered Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD)
   algorithm as described in [RFC5116].  The key, nonce, and additional
   authenticated data (aad) values are set to the values used during the
   encryption.  Unless modified by an extension, the default value of
   the aad is empty.

   If the external URL is a service, or the external content is not
   considered private, the encAlg is set to zero, and the key, nonce,
   and aad fields are zero length.

   Implementations of this specification MUST implement the AES-128-GCM
   algorithm.

4.6.  Derived Data Values

   In addition to fields which are contained in a MIMI content message,
   there is the hub accepted timestamp, which can be represented either
   as milliseconds since the start of the UNIX epoch, or for future
   extensibility as a CBOR extended time tag as defined in {{Section 3
   of !RFC9581}}. There are also two fields the implementation can
   definitely derive: (the MLS group ID {12}, and the leaf index of the
   sender {13}).  Many implementations could also determine one or more
   of: the sender's client identifier URL {14}, the user identifier URL
   of the credential associated with the sender {15}, and the identifier
   URL for the MIMI room {16}.

   MessageDerivedValues = [
       messageId: MessageId,
       hubAcceptedTimestamp: Timestamp,
       mlsGroupId: bstr,                  ; value always available {12}
       senderLeafIndex: uint .size 4,     ; value always available {13}
       senderClientUrl: uri               ; {14},
       senderUserUrl: uri,                ; "From" {15}
       roomUrl: uri                       ; "To"   {16}
   ]

   MessageId = bstr .size 32
   Timestamp = MsecsSinceEpoch / ExtendedTime
   ; milliseconds since start of UNIX epoch
   MsecsSinceEpoch = uint .size 8
   ; extended time from RFC9581
   ExtendedTime = #6.1001({* name => value })

5.  Examples

   In the following examples, we assume that an MLS group is already
   established and that either out-of-band or using the MLS protocol or
   MLS extensions, or their client to provider protocol that the
   following is known to every member of the group:

   *  The membership of the group (via MLS).
   *  The identity of any MLS client which sends an application message
      (via MLS).
   *  The MLS group ID (via MLS)
   *  The human-readable name(s) of the MIMI room, if any (out-of-band
      or extension).
   *  Which media types are mandatory to implement (MLS content
      advertisement extensions).
   *  For each member, the media types each supports (MLS content
      advertisement extensions).

   Messages sent to an MLS group are delivered to every member of the
   group active during the epoch in which the message was sent.

   All the examples start with a CBOR instance document annotated in the
   Extended Diagnostic Format (described in [Appendix G of @!RFC8610]
   and more rigorously specified in [I-D.ietf-cbor-edn-literals]), and
   then include a hex dump of the CBOR data in the pretty printed format
   popularized by the CBOR playground website (https://cbor.me
   (https://cbor.me)) with some minor whitespace and comment
   reformatting.  Finally, a message ID for the message is included for
   most messages.

   All the instance documents validate using the CDDL schemas in
   Appendix B and are included in the examples directory in the github
   repo for this document.

5.1.  Original Message

   In this example, Alice Smith sends a rich-text (Markdown) [RFC7763]
   message to the Engineering Team room.  The following values are
   derived from the client, except for the hub received timestamp, which
   needs to be made available to the client by its provider:

   *  Sender MLS leaf index: 4
   *  Sender MLS client ID URL: mimi://example.com/d/3b52249d-68f9-45ce-
      8bf5-c799f3cad7ec/0003
   *  MLS group ID: 7u4NEqe1tbeBFa0aHdsTgRyD_XOHxD5meZpZS-7aJr8
   *  The MIMI room name: "Engineering Team"
   *  The Hub received timestamp: 1644387225019 =
      2022-02-09T06:13:45.019Z

5.2.  Reply

   A reply message looks similar, but contains the message ID of the
   original message in the inReplyTo data field.  The derived MLS group
   ID, URL, and name do not change in this example.  The derived
   senderClientId and senderLeafIndex are not especially relevant so
   only the user handle URL, message ID, and hub received timestamp are
   provided (in comments at the beginning of the annotated EDN).  The
   annotated EDN follows, then the pretty printed CBOR.

5.3.  Reaction

   A reaction looks like a reply, but uses the Disposition token of
   reaction.  It is modeled on the reaction Content-Disposition token
   defined in [RFC9078].  Both indicate that the intended disposition of
   the contents of the message is a reaction.

   The content in the sample message is a single Unicode heart character
   (U+2665) which is expressed in UTF-8 as 0xe299a5.  Discovering the
   range of characters each implementation could render as a reaction
   can occur out-of-band and is not within the scope of this proposal.
   However, an implementation which receives a reaction character string
   it does not recognize could render the reaction as a reply, possibly
   prefixing with a localized string such as "Reaction: ".  Note that a
   reaction could theoretically even be another media type (ex: image,
   audio, or video), although not currently implemented in major instant
   messaging systems.  Note that many systems allow multiple independent
   reactions per sender.

   Below is the annotated message in EDN and pretty printed CBOR:

5.4.  Mentions

   In instant messaging systems and social media, a mention allows
   special formatting and behavior when a name, handle, or tag
   associated with a known group is encountered, often when prefixed
   with a commercial-at "@" character for mentions of users or a hash
   "#" character for groups or tags.  A message which contains a mention
   may trigger distinct notifications on the IM client.

   We can convey a mention by linking the user handle URI, or group URI
   in Markdown or HTML rich content.  For example, a mention using
   Markdown is indicated below.

   # MENTION
   # message ID = h'0103d50d4980c0a7a0990f65534ebd4f
   #                0fa36b1f4680d6e080c19ea4a95def7b'
   # timestamp  = 1644387243008 = 2022-02-08T22:14:03.008Z
   [
     h'04f290e215d0f82d1750bfa8b7dc089d', # salt
     null,                                # replaces
     h'',                                 # topicId
     null,                                # expires
     h'010714238126772e253118df3cd18fa6   # inReplyTo =
       9f90841d7df1f6f0cddab1f0dc0c9a26', #   Original
     {                                    # extensions
       1: "mimi://example.com/u/cathy-washington",
       2: "mimi://example.com/r/engineering_team"
     },
     [                                    # body (NestedPart)
       1,                                   # disposition = render
       "",                                  # language
       1,                                   # cardinality = single
       "text/markdown;variant=GFM-MIMI",    # contentType
                                            # content
       'Kudos to [@Alice Smith](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)' +
       ' for making the release happen!'
     ]
   ]

   The same mention using HTML [W3C.CR-html52-20170808] would instead
   replace in the EDN the contentType and content indicated below.

     / ... /
     "text/html;charset=utf-8",
     '<p>Kudos to <a href="mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith">' +
     '@Alice Smith</a> for making the release happen!</p>'

5.5.  Edit

   Unlike with email messages, it is common in IM systems to allow the
   sender of a message to edit or delete the message after the fact.
   Typically, the message is replaced in the user interface of the
   receivers (even after the original message is read) but shows a
   visual indication that it has been edited.

   The replaces data field includes the message ID of the message to
   edit/replace.  The message included in the body is a replacement for
   the message with the replaced message ID.

   Here Bob Jones corrects a typo in his original message:

   # EDIT
   # message ID = h'0177ae58cfe751f18d7c89979ceabb0d
   #                e701acb8daa2872bb353fa5f8aba1851'
   # timestamp  = 1644387248621 = 2022-02-08T22:14:08.621Z
   [
     h'b8c2e6d8800ecf45df39be6c45f4c042',  # salt
     h'01efab9eca8374d3618a16b39c658689    / replaces /
     fd90d07fe666a846178cb4965c94a8bf',    #   Reply
     h'',                                 # topicId
     null,                                # expires
     h'010714238126772e253118df3cd18fa6   # inReplyTo =
       9f90841d7df1f6f0cddab1f0dc0c9a26', #   Original
     {                                    # extensions
       1: "mimi://example.com/u/bob-jones",
       2: "mimi://example.com/r/engineering_team"
     },
     [                                    # body (NestedPart)
       1,                                   # disposition = render
       "",                                  # language
       1,                                   # cardinality = single part
       "text/markdown;variant=GFM-MIMI",    # contentType
                                            # content
       'Right on! _Congratulations_ y\'all!'
     ]
   ]

   Note that replies and reactions always refer to a specific message
   id, and therefore a specific "version" of a message, which could have
   been edited before and/or after the message id referenced in the
   reply or reaction.  It is a matter of local policy how to render (if
   at all) a reaction to a subsequently edited message.

5.6.  Delete

   In IM systems, a delete means that the author of a specific message
   has retracted the message, regardless if other users have read the
   message or not.  Typically, a placeholder remains in the user
   interface showing that a message was deleted.  Replies which
   reference a deleted message typically hide the quoted portion and
   reflect that the original message was deleted.

   If Bob deleted his message instead of modifying it, we would
   represent it using the replaces data field, and using an empty body
   (NullPart), as shown below.

   # DELETE
   # message ID = h'01fb32968cf8c5fa00e6a45431d40aa8
   #                ce4b7a92523b8bc69f3233e65023055f'
   # timestamp  = 1644387248621 = 2022-02-08T22:14:08.621Z
   [
     h'0a590d73b2c7761c39168be5ebf7f2e6', # salt
     h'01efab9eca8374d3618a16b39c658689    / replaces /
     fd90d07fe666a846178cb4965c94a8bf',    #   Reply
     h'',                                 # topicId
     null,                                # expires
     h'010714238126772e253118df3cd18fa6   # inReplyTo =
       9f90841d7df1f6f0cddab1f0dc0c9a26', #   Original
     {                                    # extensions
       1: "mimi://example.com/u/bob-jones",
       2: "mimi://example.com/r/engineering_team"
     },
     [                                    # body (NestedPart)
       1,                                   # disposition = render
       "",                                  # language
       0,                                   # cardinality = null part
     ]
   ]

5.7.  Unlike

   In most IM systems, not only is it possible to react to a message
   ("Like"), but it is possible to remove a previous reaction
   ("Unlike").  This can be accomplished by deleting the message which
   creates the original reaction

   If Cathy removes her reaction, we would represent the removal using a
   replaces data field with an empty body, referring to the message
   which created the reaction, as shown below.

   # UNLIKE
   # message ID = h'01061e20fb16aad88bd75605df8387d4
   #                fa444237451a05a72bb0f67037cc1669'
   # timestamp  = 1644387250389 = 2022-02-08T22:14:10.389Z

     h'',                                 # topicId
     null,                                # expires
     h'010714238126772e253118df3cd18fa6   # inReplyTo =
       9f90841d7df1f6f0cddab1f0dc0c9a26', #   Original
     {                                    # extensions
       1: "mimi://example.com/u/cathy-washington",
       2: "mimi://example.com/r/engineering_team"
     },
     [                                    # body (NestedPart)
       2,                                   # disposition = reaction
       "",                                  # language
       0,                                   # cardinality = null part
     ]
   ]

5.8.  Expiring

   There are two types of expiring messages in instant messaging
   systems.  In the typical implementation, messages are deleted a
   specific amount of time relative to (after) when the receiving client
   reads the message.  We will refer to this as relative expiration.

   Absolute expiring messages are designed to be deleted automatically
   by the receiving client at a certain time whether they have been read
   or not.

   As with manually deleted messages, there is no guarantee that an
   uncooperative client or a determined user will not save the content
   of the message.  The goal instead is to allow cooperating client that
   respect the convention to signal expiration times clearly.

   The expires data field contains the absolute timestamp when, or
   relative amount of time after reading, after which the message can be
   deleted.  The semantics of the header are that the message is
   automatically deleted by the receiving clients at the indicated time
   without user interaction or network connectivity necessary.

5.9.  Attachments

   An ExternalPart is a convenient way to present both "attachments" and
   (possibly inline rendered) content which is too large to be included
   in an MLS application message.  The disposition data field is set to
   inline if the sender recommends inline rendering, or attachment if
   the sender intends the content to be downloaded or rendered
   separately.

   Other dispositions of external content are also possible, for example
   an external GIF animation of a rocket ship could be used with a
   reaction disposition.

5.10.  Conferencing

   Joining a conference via an external URL is possible.  The link could
   be rendered to the user, requiring a click.  Alternatively the URL
   could be in an ExternalPart with a disposition of session, which
   could be processed differently by the client (for example, alerting
   the user or presenting a dialog box).  Further discussion of calling
   and conferencing functionality is out-of-scope of this document.

5.11.  Topics / Threading

   As popularized by the messaging application Slack, some messaging
   applications have a notion of a Topic or message Thread (not to be
   confused with message threading as used in email).  Clients beginning
   a new "topic" populate the topicId with a unique opaque octet string.
   This could be the message ID of the first message sent related to the
   topic.  Subsequent messages may include the same topicId for those
   messages to be associated with the same topic.  The sort order for
   messages within a thread uses the timestamp field.  If more than one
   message has the same timestamp, the lexically lowest message ID sorts
   earlier.

6.  Delivery Reporting and Read Receipts

   In instant messaging systems, read receipts typically generate a
   distinct indicator for each message.  In some systems, the number of
   users in a group who have read the message is subtly displayed and
   the list of users who read the message is available on further
   inspection.

   Of course, Internet mail has support for read receipts as well, but
   the existing message disposition notification mechanism defined for
   email in [RFC8098] is completely inappropriate in this context:

   *  notifications can be sent by intermediaries
   *  only one notification can be sent about a single message per
      recipient
   *  a human-readable version of the notification is expected
   *  each notification can refer to only one message
   *  it is extremely verbose

   Instead, we would like to be able to include status changes about
   multiple messages in each report, the ability to mark a message
   delivered, then read, then unread, then expired for example.

   The format below, application/mimi-message-status is sent by one
   member of an MLS group to the entire group and can refer to multiple
   messages in that group.  The format contains a list of message ID /
   status pairs.  As the status at the recipient changes, the status can
   be updated in a subsequent notification.

   The status of each message can be one of the following values:

   *  0 (unread) indicates that the message was not yet read by the
      sender of the report.
   *  1 (delivered) indicates that a messaging client of the sender of
      the report received the message.
   *  2 (read) indicates that the sender of the report read the message.
   *  3 (expired) indicates that the message expired and is not
      available for reading.  In the case of absolute expiration, it
      does not indicate if the message was read before its expiry.
   *  4 (deleted) indicates that the message was deleted, either by the
      local client, or by another member of the room with the power to
      retract messages.
   *  5 (hidden) indicates that the message was hidden by the local
      client (for example archived).
   *  6 (error) indicates that the sender client is aware of the message
      ID, but that there was an unspecified error with the reception of
      the message.

   Depending on the policy of the room and a potential sender of
   delivery reports, sending delivery receipts and/or read receipt
   messages might be required, optional, or forbidden.  Clients might
   also have policies about specific status values that are shared and
   others which are not.  Some status values might only be shared among
   the reporting user's own clients, for example.

   Below is the CDDL schema for message status.

   MessageStatusReport = [ * PerMessageStatus ]

   PerMessageStatus = [
       messageId: MessageId,
       status: baseStatus / $extStatus / unknownStatus
   ]

7.  Support for Specific Media Types

7.1.  MIMI Required and Recommended media types

   As the MIMI Content container is just a container, the plain text or
   rich text messages sent inside, and any image or other formats needs
   to be specified.  Clients compliant with MIMI MUST be able to receive
   the following media types:

   *  application/mimi-content -- the MIMI Content container format
      (described in this document)
   *  text/plain;charset=utf-8
   *  text/markdown;variant=GFM-MIMI -- Github Flavored Markdown for
      MIMI, defined in Section 7.1.1

   Note that it is acceptable to render the contents of a received
   markdown document as plain text.

   The following MIME types are RECOMMENDED:

   *  text/markdown;variant=CommonMark -- CommonMark
      (https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30)
   *  text/html
   *  application/mimi-message-status -- (described in this document)
   *  image/jpeg
   *  image/png

   Clients compliant with this specification must be able to download
   ExternalParts with http and https URLs, and decrypt downloaded
   content encrypted with the AES-128-GCM AEAD algorithm.

7.1.1.  Specifics of Github Flavored Markdown in MIMI

   A MIMI content client supports GitHub Flavored Markdown as defined in
   [GFM], with two changes: the Autolink extension is not supported; and
   instead of the Disallowed Raw HTML extension (tagfilter), the No HTML
   extension (nohtml), which is defined here, is MANDATORY.  (For
   clarity, a fixed list of supported extensions, is further described
   in the bullet points below.)

   To implement the No HTML extension to GFM, the opening angle bracket
   (<) of any HTML tag (as defined in Section 6.10 of [GFM]) is replaced
   with &lt; before sending.  Any HTML tag in a received message is
   rendered as plain text.  Note that HTML tag includes open tags,
   closing tags, HTML comments, processing instructions, declarations,
   and CDATA sections.

   The following GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions are supported.  No
   other extensions are allowed:

   *  Tables
   *  Task list items
   *  Strikethrough
   *  No HTML

   This document specifies what can be sent inside a MIMI content
   message; it does not restrict or prescribe in any way how input from
   a user is interpreted by an Instant Messaging client that support
   MIMI, before any message resulting from that input is sent.

   Note that rendering Markdown as plain text is an acceptable form of
   "support".

7.2.  Use of proprietary media types

   As most messaging systems are proprietary, standalone systems, it is
   useful to allow clients to send and receive proprietary formats among
   themselves.  Using the functionality in the MIMI Content container,
   clients can send a message using the basic functionality described in
   this document AND a proprietary format for same-vendor clients
   simultaneously over the same group with end-to-end encryption.  An
   example is given in the Appendix.

8.3.  MIMI Content Extension Keys registry

   This document requests the creation of a new MIMI Content Extension
   Keys registry.  The registry should be under the heading of "More
   Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI)".

   The MIMI Content format defined in this document, contains an
   extensions map in each message.  The keys in the extensions map can
   be (positive or negative) integers, or text strings.  Text strings
   and negative integer keys are reserved for private use.  Positive
   integer keys are assigned in the registry under the Expert Review
   policy [RFC8126].  Integer keys between 1 and 255 are restricted to
   IETF consensus specifications.

   The columns in the registry are as follows:

   *  Key: The extension map key positive integer assigned to the MIMI
      content extension.
   *  Name: a short descriptive name for the MIMI content extension.
   *  Type: The CBOR data type of the value corresponding to the key.
      Applications with multiple, related data items are encouraged to
      register a map type that contains all the related fields.
   *  Recommended: Whether support for this MIMI content extension is
      recommended by the IETF.  Valid values are "Y", "N", and "D", as
      described below.  The default value of the "Recommended" column is
      "N".  Setting the Recommended item to "Y" or "D", or changing an
      item whose current value is "Y" or "D", requires Standards Action
      [RFC8126].
      -  Y: Indicates that the IETF has consensus, and that the item is
         RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is
         fit for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading
         of the documentation for the mechanism is necessary to
         understand the applicability of that mechanism.  The IETF could
         recommend mechanisms that have limited applicability, but will
         provide applicability statements that describe any limitations
         of the mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.
      -  N: Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF
         and that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability
         of the associated mechanism.  This does not necessarily mean
         that the mechanism is flawed, only that no consensus exists.
         The IETF might have consensus to leave an item marked as "N" on
         the basis of it having limited applicability or usage
         constraints.
      -  D: Indicates that the item is discouraged and SHOULD NOT or
         MUST NOT be used.  This marking could be used to identify
         mechanisms that might result in problems if they are used, such
         as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism that might
         cause interoperability problems in deployment.

                                 Table 1

8.3.1.  Expert Review

   Expert Review [RFC8126] registry requests are registered after a
   three-week review period on the MIMI Designated Expert (DE) mailing
   list mimi-reg-review@ietf.org (mailto:mimi-reg-review@ietf.org) on
   the advice of one or more of the MIMI DEs.

   Registration requests sent to the MIMI DEs' mailing list for review
   SHOULD use an appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register value
   in MIMI Content Extensions Keys registry").

   Within the review period, the MIMI DEs will either approve or deny
   the registration request, communicating this decision to the MIMI
   DEs' mailing list and IANA.  Denials SHOULD include an explanation
   and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
   successful.  Registration requests that are undetermined for a period
   longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention for
   resolution using the iesg@ietf.org (mailto:iesg@ietf.org) mailing
   list.

   Criteria that SHOULD be applied by the MIMI DEs includes determining
   whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
   whether it is likely to be of general applicability or useful only
   for a single application, and whether the registration description is
   clear.

   IANA MUST only accept registry updates from the MIMI DEs and SHOULD
   direct all requests for registration to the MIMI DEs' mailing list.

   In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as creating
   a conflict of interest for a particular MIMI DE, that MIMI DE SHOULD
   defer to the judgment of the other MIMI DEs.

8.4.  GFM-MIMI Markdown variant

   This document registers a new Markdown variant in the IANA Markdown
   Variants registry.  The registration template below conforms with
   [RFC7763].

Identifier: GFM-MIMI

Name: GitHub Flavored Markdown Subset for MIMI

Description:
   GitHub Flavored Markdown, without Autolinks and with no embedded HTML

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  General handling

   The following cases are examples of nonsensical values that most
   likely represent malicious messages.  These should be logged and
   discarded.

   *  sender of the message
      -  where the apparent sender is not a member of the target MLS
         group
   *  message IDs
      -  which duplicate another message ID already encountered
      -  where the first octet of the message ID is an unknown hash
         algorithm.
   *  timestamps
      -  received more than a few minutes in the future, or
      -  before the first concrete syntax of this document is published
      -  before the room containing them was created
   *  topicId
      -  the topicId is very long (greater than 4096 octets)
   *  expires
      -  refers to a date more than a year in the past (only possible
         with absolute expiration)
      -  refers to a date more than a year in the future (possible with
         both relative and absolute expiration)
   *  body
      -  has too many body parts (more than 1024)
      -  is nested too deeply (more than 4 levels deep)
      -  is too large (according to local policy)
      -  has an unknown PartSemantics value

   For the avoidance of doubt, the following cases may be examples of
   legitimate use cases, and should not be considered the result of a
   malicious sender.

   *  message IDs
      -  where inReplyTo or replaces refer to an unknown message.  Such
         a message could have been sent before the local client joined.
   *  body
      -  where a body part contains an unrecognized Disposition value.
         The unknown value should be treated as if it where render.
      -  where a contentType is unrecognized or unsupported.
      -  where a language tag is unrecognized or unsupported.

9.2.  Generating the random salt

   To ensure a strong source of entropy for the per-message unique salt
   required in each message, the client can export a secret from the MLS
   key schedule, for example with the label salt_base_secret and
   calculate the salt as the HMAC of a locally generated nonce and the
   franking_base_secret.

   salt = HMAC_SHA256( salt_base_secret, nonce )

9.3.  Rendering and authorization of edits and deletes

   This content format allows clients to send new versions of previously
   sent messages, effectively replacing ("editing") or retracting
   ("deleting") another referenced message.  The rendering of these
   "edits" and "deletes" are important from a security perspective.

   For example, if Alice writes "Bob, could I borow a pen?", and Bob
   reacts with a thumbs up emoji, Alice might edit this message with no
   change in meaning (correcting the spelling of "borrow"), or a
   dramatic change in meaning ("Bob, could I borrow your Ferrari this
   month?").  The receiver SHOULD indicate clearly that a received
   message has been edited or retracted.  The receiver might:

   *  offer an option to view previous versions of a message,
   *  show a summarized or thumbnail version of a message referenced in
      a reply,
   *  indicate clearly that a reply was to a previous version of a
      message than the most recent one.
   *  show a detailed view of reaction indicating that some reactions
      referred to a previous version of the message.

   In addition, some groups may have special policies or permissions
   allowing specific types of edits or deletes.  For example, a
   moderator in one room might be allowed to edit the topic of a
   message, but not modify the rest of the content.  An administrator
   might be allowed to delete messages which violate the policy of the
   group.  Receiving clients MUST NOT allow parties other than the
   original sender of a message to edit or delete that message, unless
   there is a specific, concrete authorization policy which allows it.
   Likewise, even the original sender of a message MUST NOT be able to
   change the semantics of any other portion of the message except for
   the contents of the NestedPart, without specific authorization.

9.4.  Validation of timestamp

   The timestamp is the time a message is accepted by the hub provider.
   As such, the hub provider can manipulate the timestamp, and the
   sending provider can delay sending messages selectively to cause the
   timestamp on a hub to be later.  Note that the optional franking
   mechanism discussed in Section 5.4.1.2 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol]
   prevents follower servers from modifying the timestamp.

   |  *TODO*: Discuss how to sanity check lastSeen, timestamp and the
   |  MLS epoch and generation, and the limitations of this approach.

9.5.  Alternate content rendering

   This document includes a mechanism where the sender can offer
   alternate versions of content in a single message.  For example, the
   sender could send:

   *  an plain text and an HTML version of a text message
   *  a thumbnail preview and link to a high-resolution image or video
   *  versions of the same message in multiple languages
   *  an PNG image and a scalable vector graphics version of a line
      drawing

   A malicious client could use this mechanism to send content that will
   appear different to a subset of the members of a group and possibly
   elicit an incorrect or misleading response.

   Message as seen by Alice (manager)
   Xavier: Do you want me to reserve a room for the review meeting?

   Message as seen by Bob (Alice's assistant)
   Xavier: @Bob I need to pickup Alice's Ferarri keys. She'll confirm

   Reply sent by Alice
   Alice: Yes please.

9.6.  Link and Mention handling

   Both Markdown and HTML support links.  Using the example of an https
   link, if the rendered text and the link target match exactly or are
   canonically equivalent, there is no need for confirmation if the end
   user selects the link.

   [example.com/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)
   [https://example.com/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)
   [https://example.com:443/foobar](https://example.com/foobar)

   However, if the link text is different, or the scheme is downgraded
   from https to http, the user should be presented with an alert
   warning that the text is not the same.

   [https://example.com/foobar](https://spearphishers.example/foobar)
   [https://example.com/foobar](http://example.com/foobar)

   An IM URI link to a user who has a member client in the MLS group in
   which the message was sent is considered a mention.  Clients may
   support special rendering of mentions instead of treating them like
   any other type of link.  In Markdown and HTML, the display text
   portion of a link is considered a rendering hint from the sender to
   the receiver of the message.  The receiver should use local policy to
   decide if the hint is an acceptable local representation of the user
   represented by the link itself.  If the hint is not an acceptable
   representation, the client should instead display its canonical
   representation for the user.

   For example, in the first example, the sender expresses no preference
   about how to render the mention.  In the second example, the sender
   requests that the mention is rendered as the literal URI.  In the
   third example, the sender requests the canonical handle for Alice.
   In the fourth example, the sender requests Alice's first name.

   <mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith>
   [mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)
   [@AliceSmith](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)
   [Alice](mimi://example.com/u/alice-smith)

   Note that in some clients, presence of a mention for the local user
   may result in a different notification policy.

   If the client does not support special rendering of mentions, the
   application, should render the text like any other link.

9.7.  Delivery and Read Receipts

   Delivery and Read Receipts can provide useful information inside a
   group, or they can reveal sensitive private information.  In many IM
   systems there is are per-group policies for and/or delivery read
   receipts:

   *  they are required
   *  they are permitted, but optional
   *  they are forbidden

   In the first case, everyone in the group would have to claim to
   support read receipts to be in the group and agree to the policy of
   sending them whenever a message was read.  A user who did not wish to
   send read receipts could review the policy (automatically or
   manually) and choose not to join the group.  Of course, requiring
   read receipts is a cooperative effort just like using self-deleting
   messages.  A malicious client could obviously read a message and not
   send a read receipt, or send a read receipt for a message that was
   never rendered.  However, cooperating clients have a way to agree
   that they will send read receipts when a message is read in a
   specific group.

   In the second case, sending a read receipt would be at the discretion
   of each receiver of the message (via local preferences).

   ]

   NullPart = ( cardinality: nullpart )

A.2.  Implied Message Fields

   Below is a CDDL schema for the implied message fields.

   MessageDerivedValues = [

   ExtendedTime = #6.1001({* name => value })
   name = int / tstr .size (1..255)
   value = any .size (0..4095)

A.3.  Delivery Report Format

   MessageStatusReport = [ * PerMessageStatus ]

   PerMessageStatus = [
       messageId: MessageId,
       status: baseStatus / $extStatus / unknownStatus

       error: 6
   )
   unknownStatus = &( unknown: 7..255 )

   MessageId = bstr .size 32

Appendix B.  Multipart examples

   In a heterogeneous group of IM clients, it is often desirable to send
   more than one media type as alternatives, such that IM clients have a
   choice of which media type to render.  For example, imagine an IM
   group containing a set of clients which support a common video format
   and a subset which only support animated GIFs.  The sender could use
   a MultiPart NestablePart with chooseOne semantics containing both
   media types.  Every client in the group chat could render something
   resembling the media sent.  This is analogous to the multipart/
   alternative [RFC2046] media type.

   Likewise, it is often desirable to send more than one media type
   intended to be rendered together as in (for example a rich text
   document with embedded images), which can be represented using a
   MultiPart NestablePart with processAll semantics.  This is analogous
   to the multipart/mixed [RFC2046] media type.

   Note that there is a minor semantic difference between multipart/
   alternative and MultiPart with chooseOne semantics.  In multipart/
   alternative, the parts are presented in preference order by the
   sender.  With MultiPart the receiver chooses its "best" format to
   render according to its own preferences.

B.1.  Proprietary and Common formats sent as alternatives

   This shows sending a message containing both this profile and a
   proprietary messaging format simultaneously.
